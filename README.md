## Alt-Text Display extension for Chromium (Edge/Chrome)

This is an extension that adds a menu item to the context menu on any image to display the source and the alternative text of the image.

When activated, you get a "sticky note" on the document that shows the source and the alternative text. You can move the sticky note by dragging the header and you can close it by clicking the "x".

### Support and questions

This is a beta build of this extension and I am planning to use the research attached to it to develop new features in the Chromium Developer Tools. 

You can use it as-is now and contributions are welcome.
